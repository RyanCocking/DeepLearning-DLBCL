# WTRotation2-DeepLearning
Using deep learning image classification to identify the gene of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tissue samples from IHC-stained histopathology slides. Supervised by Professor David R Westhead at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds.

REQUIREMENTS

python >= 3.6.9

apt-get install: openslide-tools
